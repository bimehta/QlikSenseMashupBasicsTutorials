_NOTE:_ These code samples work with Qlik Sense 1.1.  The previous samples were for Sense 1.0 and no longer work for the latest version of Sense 

This is simply a place to keep the code samples that will be used in a series of tutorials about the basics of using the Mash-up APIs in Qlik Sense.
Each folder in the code samples folder covers a basic function of the library.  Videos will be posted soon explaining each one.
